/**
 * 1765. Map of Highest Peak
 * You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water cells.
 *
 * If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
 * If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
 * You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
 *
 * The height of each cell must be non-negative.
 * If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
 * Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
 * Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.
 *
 * Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
